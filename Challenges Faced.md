## Challenge Faced:  

:one: Artist Genre Data Collection Limitation  

    **Description:** The project relied on Spotify data and the Spotipy library to map artists to genres. However, a significant number of artists had no associated genre in the library.  

    **Impact on Data Integrity:** The absence of genre data for many artists could reduce the accuracy and reliability of my dashboard analysis, potentially skewing results.  

    **Solution:** To mitigate this, I supplemented the missing genres using a combination of ChatGPT for genre suggestions and Excel for organization. This ensured a more complete and representative dataset while acknowledging the potential for minor inaccuracies in the supplemented data.  

:two: Podcast Genre Data Collection Limitation  

    **Description:** Similar to the artist genre data collection issue, Spotify does not provide genres for all podcast shows. 

    **Impact on Data Integrity:**  The inability to include podcast genres prevented a comprehensive genre analysis across both music artists and podcasts, limiting the depth of the final dashboard.

    **Solution:** Podcast genres were excluded from the analysis to maintain data quality and focus on accurate insights for music genres.
