## Challenges Faced:  

:one: Artist Genre Data Collection Limitation  

  **Description:** The project relied on Spotify data and the Spotipy library to map artists to genres. However, a significant number of artists had no associated genre in the library.  
  
  **Impact on Data Integrity:** The absence of genre data for many artists could reduce the accuracy and reliability of my dashboard analysis, potentially skewing results.  
  
  **Solution:** To mitigate this, I supplemented the missing genres using a combination of ChatGPT for genre suggestions and Excel for organization. This ensured a more complete and representative dataset while acknowledging the potential for minor inaccuracies in the supplemented data.  

:two: Podcast Genre Data Collection Limitation  

**Description:** Similar to the artist genre data collection issue, Spotify does not provide genres for all podcast shows. 
    
**Impact on Data Integrity:**  The inability to include podcast genres prevented a comprehensive genre analysis across both music artists and podcasts, limiting the depth of the final dashboard.

**Solution:** Podcast genres were excluded from the analysis to maintain data quality and focus on accurate insights for music genres.

:three: Overall Data Collection Limitation

**Description:** My Spotify account is part of a Duo Family Plan, meaning the streaming history includes data from multiple users.

**Impact on Data Integrity:**  This dataset does not exclusively represent my personal streaming preferences, which limits its accuracy in reflecting individual habits.

**Solution:** Despite this limitation, the dataset still provides valuable insights into general trends in my track and podcast preferences. For the purpose of this project, it remains a meaningful and useful dataset.
