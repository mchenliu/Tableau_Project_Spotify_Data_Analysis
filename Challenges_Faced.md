## Challenges Faced:  

:one: Artist Genre Data Collection Limitation  

- **🖊️ Description:** The project relied on Spotify data and the Spotipy library to map artists to genres. However, a significant number of artists had no associated genre in the library.  
  
- **🔒 Impact on Data Integrity:** The absence of genre data for many artists could reduce the accuracy and reliability of my dashboard analysis, potentially skewing results.  
  
- **🚀 Solution:** To mitigate this, I supplemented the missing genres using a combination of ChatGPT for genre suggestions and Excel for organization. This ensured a more complete and representative dataset while acknowledging the potential for minor inaccuracies in the supplemented data.  

:two: Podcast Genre Data Collection Limitation  

- **🖊️ Description:** Similar to the artist genre data collection issue, Spotify does not provide genres for all podcast shows. 
    
- **🔒 Impact on Data Integrity:**  The inability to include podcast genres prevented a comprehensive genre analysis across both music artists and podcasts, limiting the depth of the final dashboard.

- **🚀 Solution:** Podcast genres were excluded from the analysis to maintain data quality and focus on accurate insights for music genres.

:three: Overall Data Collection Limitation

- **🖊️ Description:** My Spotify account is part of a Duo Family Plan, meaning the streaming history includes data from multiple users.

- **🔒 Impact on Data Integrity:**  This dataset does not exclusively represent my personal streaming preferences, which limits its accuracy in reflecting individual habits.

- **🚀 Solution:** Despite this limitation, the dataset still provides valuable insights into general trends in my track and podcast preferences. For the purpose of this project, it remains a meaningful and useful dataset.

:four: Difficulty in Logo Generation
- 🖊️ Description: Encountered challenges in creating professional logos and icons for the dashboard.
- 🔒 Impact on Project: The absence of polished visuals may compromise the dashboard’s perceived professionalism and user experience.
- 🚀 Solution: Leveraged available tools like ChatGPT and draw.io to create logos and icons manually. For future dashboards, I plan to explore more advanced design solutions to improve visual quality.
