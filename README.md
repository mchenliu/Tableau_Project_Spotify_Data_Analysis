# Introducation
ðŸ“£ In this project, I used dataset from my [Python Spotify Analysis Project](https://github.com/mchenliu/Capstone_Project_Spotify_Data_Analysis) to create a set of dynamic dashboard to uncover insights into my listening habits.
## Tools Used
**:art: Tableau:** A powerful tool for creating data visualizations and business intelligence dashboards, enabling insightful analysis and reporting.  
**:pencil2: draw.io:** Used to sketch the container structures for dashboard design.  
**:computer: Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight, versatile code editor. I utilized Visual Studio Code to edit project scripts and manage images, ensuring seamless integration and synchronization with GitHub for version control and collaboration.  
**:octopus: Git & Github:** My go-to for version control and tracking my project progress.  
# Steps to Build Dashboards
## :one: Define User Requirements
As a music lover, I want to know which artists I listened to the most each month so I can track how my music taste evolves over time.

Details: Include top artists, their play counts, and trends month-over-month.
As a user, I want to analyze my listening duration for each day of the week so I can find my peak music consumption times.

Details: Visualize hours with a heatmap or bar chart.
As a playlist curator, I want to see which tracks I skipped most often so I can refine my playlists.

Details: Include skip rates, track names, and reasons (e.g., backbtn, endplay).
As a fan of nostalgia, I want to see the oldest tracks in my history so I can relive older moments.

Details: Add a filter for track release year (if available).
