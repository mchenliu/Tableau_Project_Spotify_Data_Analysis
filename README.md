# Introducation
üì£ In this project, I used dataset from my [Python Spotify Analysis Project](https://github.com/mchenliu/Capstone_Project_Spotify_Data_Analysis) to create a set of dynamic dashboard to uncover insights into my listening habits.  

:mag: Check out my Spotify Streaming dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mei.liu4813/viz/SpotifyDashboard_17338950683000/SpotifyOverview). 

## Tools Used
**:bar_chart: Excel:** Used Power Query to clean data before importing to Tableau.  
**ü§ñ ChatGPT:** Used to genrate logos and serves as assistance for the project.  
**:art: Tableau:** A powerful tool for creating data visualizations and business intelligence dashboards, enabling insightful analysis and reporting.  
**:pencil2: draw.io:** Used to sketch the dashboard design and container structures.  
**:computer: Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight, versatile code editor. I utilized Visual Studio Code to edit project scripts and manage images, ensuring seamless integration and synchronization with GitHub for version control and collaboration.  
**:octocat: Git & Github:** My go-to for version control and tracking my project progress.  
# Steps to Build Dashboards
## :one: Define [User Requirements](/UserStory.md)
**üßë‚Äçüíº Identify Target Audience:** The dashboard is designed for myself to address two primary needs:
  1. Overivew: Provides high-level insights into key streaming metrics of music tracks and podcast episodes.
  2. Streaming Details View: Enables detailed exploration of individual streaming data.

**üåê Overview:** Divided into three sections to provide comprehensive metrics:
  1. Overivew: Key streaming stats:  
    - Total hours played  
    - Average hours played per day  
    - Number of music tracks and podcast episodes played  
    - Location distribution of podcasts and music played  
  2. Genre Analysis:  
    - Genre composition by time of day  
    - Correlation between genre and total skips
  3. Artist Preference:  
    - Total playtime by home vs. away  
    - Top 5 artists/ shows by playtime  
    - Relationship between skip rate and total playtime for top 20 artists/shows.

üí° Streaming Details View:
  1. Detailed list of streaming history (date played, location, tracks played/skipped, episodes played/skipped and hours played).
  2. Fully filterable by any column.


## :two: Build Data Source (ETL)
- **Extract:** Connected the dataset to Tableau and conducted an initial inspection to verify data quality and ensure accurate data type mapping.
- **Transform:**
  - *Music_Streaming_History* and *Podcast_Streaming_History*: Standardized column structures and unioned the files in Tableau for seamless integration.
  - *Cleaned_Artist_Genre*: Cleaned the columns to ensure each row represents a single genre and added missing genre data for artists. Faced some challenges during data collection; see [Challenges Faced](/Challenges_Faced.md) for details..
- **Load:**
  - Loaded the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
  - Built a data model by unioning *Music_Streaming_History* and *Podcast_Streaming_History*, renaming it as *All Streaming History*. Established a relationship between *All Streaming History* and *Cleaned_Artist_Genre* by mapping the `artist name` column in both tables.
  - Explored the data using Tableau worksheets to understand relationships and potential insights.

## :three: Build Charts  
**:white_check_mark: Chart Selection:** After assessing the user requirements,I analyzed user requirements to select the most effective chart types for presenting data and sketached a blueprint for dashboard design.

*Overview Dashbboard Design*
![overview dashboard](/Images/Overview_Dashboard_Design.png)  

*Details Dashboard Design*  
![details dashboard](/Images/Details_Dashboard_Design.png)  
**:triangular_ruler: Template Design:** Created a reusable template defining the following:  
  - Colors: `#418dcc`, `#de075a`, `#787878` and `#e3e3e3`
  - Font: Trebuchet MS
  - Background: Dark theme  

**:1234: Calculated fields** developed to enhance chart functionality:  
| Field Name | Formula |  
|------------|---------|
| Total Days | DATEDIFF ('day', MIN ([Date Time]), MAX ([Date Time])) |
| Music Group | IF [Type] ='Music Track' <br> THEN 'Music Tracks' <br> END |
| Time Slot | IF DATEPART('hour' ,[Date Time]) > 6 AND DATEPART('hour',[Date Time]) < 12 THEN 'Morning' <br> ELSEIF  DATEPART('hour' ,[Date Time]) >=12 AND  DATEPART ('hour',[Date Time]) < 18 THEN 'Afternoon' <br> ELSEIF DATEPART ('hour', [Date Time]) >= 18 AND  DATEPART('hour', [Date Time]) < 24 THEN 'Night' <br> ELSE 'Over Night' <br> END |
| Music Hours Played | IF [Type] = 'Music Track' <br> THEN [Ms Played]/1000/60/60 <br> ELSE 0 <br> END |
| Music Skip Count | SUM(IF [Type] = 'Music Track' AND [Skipped] = True <br> THEN 1 <br> ELSE 0 <br> END) | 
| No. of Tracks | COUNT(If [Track Name] <> 'No Track Name'<br> THEN [Track Name] <br> END) |

**:abacus: Charts Used**  
Each chart type was selected for its ability to effectively communicate specific insights:  

- üìà BAN (Big Ass Numbers) + Line Chart: Ideal for presenting KPIs at a glance. I combined BANs with line charts to show KPIs and trends for tracks vs. episodes over time.  
![BAN](/Images/Charts/BAN%20&%20Line.PNG)  

- üìä Bar Chart: Effective for visualizing distributions. I used bar chart to highlight top 5 genres.
![Bar](/Images/Charts/Bar.PNG)  

- üó∫Ô∏è Map: Used to illustrate location.  
![Map](/Images/Charts/Map.PNG)  

- üçï Pie Chart: Represented location distribution alongside music tracks vs. podcast episode ratios.
![Pie](/Images/Charts/Pie.PNG)  

- üî• Heat Map: Highlighted relationships and distributions between dimensions. The highest percentages and counts were visually emphasized. Two heat maps were created to analyze relationships between:  
  - Genre vs. Time Slot
  - Genre vs. Skipped (True/False)

- üî¥‚ûñ‚ö™ Barbell Chart: Revealed the location playtime gap across top five artists/ podcast shows, providing a clear view of disparities.

- üåå Scatter Plot: Demonstrated the relationship between hours played and skip rate for music tracks and podcast shows, uncovering potential trends and correlations.
