:target: User Story
As a Spotify user and data analyst, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze my Spotify streaming history, providing both high-level insights through summary views and detailed metrics for an in-depth understanding of my listening habits.

Summary View
The summary view will consist of three main sections: Listening Overview, Genre Analysis, and Artist Preferences.

Listening Overview
Display the total hours spent on tracks and podcasts, along with the average daily listening time for podcasts and music separately.
Visualize the monthly total number of tracks and podcasts played over the years.
Present a breakdown of listening activity for podcasts and music by location (e.g., Home vs. Travel).
Highlight the distribution of podcast and music playtime by location (Home vs. Travel).
Genre Analysis
Highlight the top 10 music genres.
Compare genre preferences by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Night, and Overnight).
Analyze genre preferences based on skip behavior (Skipped vs. Not Skipped).
Artist Preferences
The artist preference analysis will focus on artist-specific metrics, including:

Compare the top 10 most-played artists across different locations (Home vs. Away) for both podcasts and music to identify regional artist preferences.
Examine the correlation between skip rate and total playtime for the top 20 artists and the top 20 podcast shows.
